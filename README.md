# convenience

Whenever I come up with an idea for a miscellaneous function that could apply in a variety of situations, I'll try and create a well-documented, versatile and efficient implementation of it here in the convenience.py file. Unit tests would also be nice to have in case I want to make any changes in the future without dramatically altering a function's functionality.
